# Blackjack
CSC 460 Final Project 

a) The zip folder Blackjack01 contains the first version of the project without functionality. You can only click buttons from the start window to achieve focus from one window to the next. 

b) Name the later versions with their appropriate numbers. For example, the second one as Blackjack02, the third one Blackjack03, etc. to keep track of major changes.
